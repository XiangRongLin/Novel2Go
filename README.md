# Extracting PDF
Novel2Go extracts the reading content from a website and creates a PDF from it.  
It can download:
- a single chapter from a single url for to the chapter
- multiple chapters from an url for the table of contents site of the series. It preselects some chapters and lets you confirm them. Between each download is a 5 second wait time, to avoid making too many request at once.

It downloads everything in the background, as long as the app is running.

A single chapter can be send by using the option in the drow down menu.  
Multiple chapters can be selected by first long pressing a chapter and then clicking on the envelope icon to send them all together.
